# RISC-hpc
A research project on building a scalable supercomputer using RISC architecture for high-performance computing (HPC).
# ðŸš€ RISC-Based Supercomputer Project

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project explores the design and development of a **supercomputer built on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture**.  
With the rise of **RISC-V and ARM-based processors** in modern computing, this research investigates how RISC principles â€” simplicity, modularity, and efficiency â€” can be scaled to achieve **high-performance computing (HPC)** capabilities comparable to conventional supercomputers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives
- Investigate the potential of **RISC architectures** in high-performance and parallel computing.  
- Develop a **scalable cluster design** using multiple RISC-based cores/nodes.  
- Evaluate **performance-per-watt** improvements over traditional CISC-based HPC systems.  
- Explore **parallel programming models** (MPI, OpenMP) on RISC-based clusters.  
- Benchmark the design using **industry-standard HPC benchmarks** (LINPACK, SPEC).

## ðŸ“š Research Context
Supercomputers today rely heavily on **CISC-based processors (x86)**, which deliver raw performance but at significant **power and cooling costs**.  
RISC processors, in contrast, offer **simplicity and efficiency**, making them highly attractive for building **sustainable, energy-efficient supercomputers**.  

This project is an attempt to push the boundaries of **green computing** and **scalable HPC architectures**, envisioning a future where RISC dominates the **HPC and AI supercomputing landscape**.

## ðŸ”¬ Future Directions
- Integration of **AI accelerators** with RISC clusters.  
- Development of **heterogeneous HPC environments** (CPU + GPU + FPGA).  
- **Cloud-native RISC supercomputing** for distributed scientific workloads.  
- Collaboration with academic/industry labs for real-world deployment.
